Comments for Tutor (Jerry – Jianwei Chen):
Jerry contributed to the initial UI template for the project. However, when I (Rianna) was addressing build errors and converting the project into an app, 
I had to rebase the entire repository. As a result, the first commit largely reflects Jerry’s original UI work, 
even though the commit history may not show the full extent of his contributions due to the rebasing process.
